to run the web app you will need Xampp software but you need not to run the app, i have put screenshots of how it works.

At the begining you will be at the home page,
to add and upload readings, click on the Add tab.
when view tab will be pressed, it will take you to the ThingSpeak link where all the data is stored.

for the python file, you will need the jupyter notebook and the required libraries to run the program.
the model is trained to learn from the given temperature-humidity data and when given a new temperature it will predict the humidity of that point.
note: you will need to upload data.xlsx file to jupyter notebook before running the program.
